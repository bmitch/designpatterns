## Observer Pattern ##
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Easy metaphor is a newspaper publisher and its subscribers

## Design Principles ##
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
